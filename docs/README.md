# Discordium Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the discordium C++ library. This library provides convenient ways to interact with the Discord API in your C++ projects.

## Getting Started

To generate the documentation locally, you can use [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/):

1. Install Doxygen if you haven’t already.
2. Navigate to the `docs/` directory.
3. Run `doxygen Doxyfile` to generate the HTML documentation.

The documentation will be available in the `docs/build/html` directory.

## Directory Structure

- `docs/` — Contains the Doxygen config and other documentation files.
- `src/` — Contains the source code for the project.
- `include/` — Header files for the library.
